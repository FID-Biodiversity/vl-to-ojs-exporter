[General]
# If there is a file called items.txt in the package folder, it will be taken as a list of items to process.
# If in the Process section a list in the items is given, this will have precedence.
# The given items in the file, can be comma seperated or on a single line each.
# So, this is fine:
    # item1, item2, item3
# And this is fine too:
    # item1
    # item2
    # item3
# Please, without the hashes! Only the IDs to download!
itemFile = items.txt

# This should give the languages of the OJS journal, where the final XML is read to!
# Watch out that you use double quotes (") for quoting, because single quotes cause an error...
